Accessibility, information retrieval, editability, and association on social media increases the likelihood of cyberbullying.  Social media sites that allow greater anonymity like yik yak have higher rates of cyberbullying perpetration.  Since popular social media presence creates an overwhelming symbol of social status people are more likely to look down on others without this so-called “popularity” almost like they would in real life.  A longitudinal study of youth in Singapore found that social media use facilitated the development of positive attitudes toward cyberbullying, which increased the likelihood of cyberbullying perpetration.
